                    The Knowledge Graph for Irish History offers a new and dynamic way to discover the interconnected histories
                    of people
                    and places in Ireland, from the middle ages to the twenty-first century. By weaving together individual
                    threads of data, we can now experience Irish history through connections linking people across political,
                    economic, social, and cultural life in Ireland.

                <p>
                    The Knowledge Graph brings together data from many different sources. One of these sources is the Dictionary
                    of Irish Biography (DIB), an authoritative reference work of data containing biographies of the most notable
                    figures in Irish history.

                <p>
                    “The DIB is a project of the Royal Irish Academy. It tells the island's life story through the biographies,
                    at home and overseas, of prominent men and women born in Ireland, north and south, and the noteworthy Irish
                    careers of those born outside of Ireland.”

                <p>
                    As part of a collaboration between Beyond 2022 and The Dictionary of Irish Biography, we explore the
                    representation of individuals in the DIB dataset through a set of interactive visualisations. This visual
                    story experiments with new ways of representing and understanding a large and complex historical data set
                    and discovers how historical data can shape our views of the past.

                    The visualisation below shows a bird's-eye view of the Knowledge Graph for Irish History. The inner circles
                    show various groups of data in the knowledge graph, called "subgraphs". The size of each circle shows the
                    number of entities (such as individual people or places) contained in each subgraph.

                    By splitting the DIB subgraph by gender, we can see there are many more entries about men than women. Let’s
                    focus on the women contained in the DIB subgraph. This visualisation shows all the women within the DIB
                    subgraph. Each circle represents an individual woman.

                    In the DIB, "areas of interest" are used to categorise historical figures, often grouping them together
                    according to particular themes or subjects. The visualisation below shows the frequency of all "areas of
                    interest" associated with the women in the DIB subgraph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each circle represents a different category. The size of the circle tells us how many women fall under that
                    area of interest. As you can see, the most common areas of interest for the women in the DIB are Literature,
                    Politics, Religion, Arts and Crafts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These categories can also tell us about a person's social status or the type of career they held, helping
                    researchers to search for individual biographies or specific groups of people. Women whose area of interest
                    is tagged as Literature were likely writers or poets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other tags are harder to categorise. For instance, there are three women associated with an Area of Interest
                    labelled The Sea. One is <a href="https://www.dib.ie/biography/omalley-grainne-grace-granuaile-a6886"
                        target="_blank">Gráinne O'Malley</a>, who was a sea captain. Another is <a

                    who was a marine biologist. But the last one is <a

                    The visualisation below shows areas of interest for both men and women in the DIB subgraph. The size of the
                    circle tells us the total number of people with that area of interest. The blue circles indicate how many
                    people in each area of interest are men. The yellow circles indicate how many people are women. Do you
                    notice anything new?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Areas of interest historically dominated by men occur more often in this visualisation. This is because
                    historians of
                    the past focused more on notable men than notable women in Irish history. This focus still shapes how we
                    understand the past, including the categories we use to document it. For example, having an area of interest
                    for The Sea makes more sense knowing that it primarily contains male shipbuilders, or men in the navy.

                    Next, let's take a closer look at the women in the DIB dataset. This visualisation shows the distribution of
                    areas of
                    interest associated with women across many centuries. The size of the circle indicates how frequently that

                    interest appears in that time period. If you click on a circle, you can explore instances of that area of

                    We can see there is an explosion of new areas of interest in the twentieth century. During this time, the
                    growth of education, industry and technology opened new doors for women, helping them to access more public,
                    well-documented roles in Irish life. This helps to explain why most biographies for women within the DIB
                    come from the twentieth century.

                    The DIB subgraph also contains lots of information about another category: occupations. This category
                    provides more
                    detailed information than areas of interest: it can tell us a person's job, title or the main role they were
                    known for in life.

                <p>
                    The visualisation below shows the frequency of all occupations held by women in the DIB subgraph. Each
                    circle represents a different occupation. The size of the circle tells us how many women held that

                    Occupations give us a lot of data. We can connect this data to specific women in the DIB subgraph. For
                    example, see if you can zoom in to find the circle labelled "King of Leinster". The woman attached to this
                    occupation was named <a href="https://www.dib.ie/biography/aife-aoife-eva-a0069" target="_blank">Aife</a>.
                    Aife was the daughter of <a

                        target="_blank">Diarmait Mac Murchada</a>, king of Leinster in the twelfth century. However, Aife was
                    not the king of Leinster herself; if we check her DIB biography, we discover that her occupation was
                    probably meant to read "daughter of the king of Leinster".

                    The next visualisation shows the occupations for both men and women in the DIB subgraph. Again, the size of
                    the circle tells us each occupation's total frequency in the subgraph. The blue circles indicate how many
                    people in each occupation are men. The orange circles indicate how many people are women.

                    Here, we see the sheer amount of rich information contained in just one dataset!. We can explore thousands
                    of lives
                    across Irish history through the diverse range of careers identified by DIB biographers. Some occupations
                    show up
                    frequently through the centuries, like the 804 men and 39 women listed as Politicians. Other occupations are
                    unique to individuals. <a href="https://www.dib.ie/biography/fossett-edward-a3337" target="_blank">Edward
                        Fossett</a>, for example, is the only person documented as a Circus Owner in the DIB.

                    the 20th century has the broadest amount of occupations. Again, this is because the DIB has more records on
                    women from the 20th century than from other time periods. However, note which occupations appear in multiple
                    time periods and which ones appear only once. Unique occupations can teach us about individuals and the time

                    contains many thousands of entities - people, places, offices and organisations - from more than seven
                    centuries of
                    Irish history. Lodview allows you to explore the metadata associated with these people and places, and
                    discover the
                    connections that linked them.
